# GTGUI
GeocachingToolbox GUI: a graphic user interface for GeocachingToolbox.

## Quick start: how to build

1. Clone GeocachingToolbox: https://github.com/krzema12/GeocachingToolbox.
2. Build GeocachingToolbox.
3. Open GTGUI's solution and project and in project "References", add GeocachingToolbox's assembly from build/Debug folder.

This is a temporary method. In future, probably NuGet will be used to handle  GeocachingToolbox as a regular dependency.
